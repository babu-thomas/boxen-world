## Resources
- I am mostly following along the code from [MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge](https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge). This involves looking at the changes in a commit, figuring out what changed and why, and then implementing that myself.
- [http://docs.gl](docs.gl) - Awesome, searchable OpenGL documentation.
- [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) - Detailed, up-to-date OpenGL tutorials from beginner to advanced.
